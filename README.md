## Usage

### Run installs once

Install dependencies:

`npm install`

Install the example app's dependencies:

`npm run install-app`

### Run services each time you develop

Selenium and the app need to be running in the background for the specs to work. Run the `serve` script to run both of them at the same time.

`npm run serve`

### Run the specs

In another terminal window, run the Protractor specs:

`npm test`
